## Purpose

When creating my portfolio, my intention was to make an aesthetic and responsive website that exhibits my HTML and CSS skills as well as my design capabilities. The website was also designed to be clearly organised so that it could be updated easily as I finished more projects that I could publish and showcase in future iterations. Finally, the website needed to be easy to use and engage with.

### Target Audience

The website is designed for users who are fluent using webpages on both mobile devices and desktop browsers. Because the website will primarily be used by prospective employers and peers, my portfolio needs to appear impressively designed in both functionality and aesthetics. Vitally, the website needs to be straightforward to use so that viewers can engage with the information, my work and work history, easily and clearly.

## Functionality and Features

### Styling

I tried to create a colour scheme that is bright and attention-grabbing so that users are excited to engage with the different webpages. Because the website is designed to pitch my personality to employers too, I chose colours that, together, are bright and imply a playfulness.

### Responsive Navigation Buttons

A key design feature of my portfolio website is a navbar that changes between pages and features large and colourful hyperlink buttons that respond to the viewport dimensions. Aesthetically, the buttons' colours add contrast to the webpage and make it easy to navigate. By emphasising the number of different features of the website, the user is invited to explore each part and, ideally, not leave the website until they have done so. Also in regards to the user's journey, the navbar is reordered based on the page that the user is viewing. For example, most of the website's pages feature the link to the "My Work" at the top of the navbar so that they can quickly see what I am capable of, however on the "About Me" page, the top navbar item links to download my resume. This ordering is intended to compliment the page's content by contextualising the information about me with my job experience. Similarly, the individual blog pages feature the "All Blogs" index page at the top of the navbar so that the viewer can continue engaging with the blog content. The reordering of the navbar should aid user flow through the website whilst also displaying my ability to create a responsive website.

### Header and Footer



### Tech Stack

The website was designed using hand-drawn diagrams which were then digitised using [app.diagrams.net](app.diagrams.net). The website was built using HTML and CSS.
